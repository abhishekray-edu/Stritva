Map<String, List<String>> periodBloodColors = {
  "1. Bright Red": [

    "Blood clots usually occur during the heaviest days of your menstrual flow and are bright or dark red. ‚ÄòBlood clots are due to heavy bleeding, where the blood flow is faster and heavier than the body can process, leading to the formation of clots.‚Äô"
  ],
  "2. Dark Red": [
    "Dark red blood is very common, especially first thing in the morning. This is because after you‚Äôve been lying down for a while, the blood has oxidized inside your uterus before coming out.",

    "Anemia, a condition caused by low iron levels, can also cause pink period blood.",
    "Spotting can sometimes be light-pink due to the lighter nature of the bleeding.",

  ],
  "5. Orange": [
    "Orange menstrual fluid may be a result of your menstrual blood mixing with cervical fluid.",
    "Orange period blood or discharge may also be a sign of an infection, like bacterial vaginosis. Or a sexually transmitted infection, such as trichomoniasis, which is caused by a parasite."
